Meliae 0.2.0 (not released yet)
###############################

:0.2.0: (not released yet)


New Features
************

* The loader internals have been rewritten significantly. Instead of
  storing a bunch of objects in a regular python dict, they are now
  stored in a custom Pyrex collection, and proxy objects are created on
  demand.  This means significantly improved memory usage. (roughly
  2:1). (John Arbash Meinel)

* The internals change also changes the interface a bit. When viewing
  an object, a shorter display is given. One can use ``obj[offset]`` to
  get the object at that reference, rather than the reference itself.
  (so fewer indirections through the ObjManager). (John Arbash Meinel)

* Now supports the ``__sizeof__`` interface introduced in python 2.6.
  This allows a class (especially extension classes) to inform
  Meliae/Python how many bytes it is consuming in memory.
  (John Arbash Meinel)
